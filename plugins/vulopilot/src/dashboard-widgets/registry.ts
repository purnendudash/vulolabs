/**
 * The newer "Good morning" Dashboard mockup's own top section, in its exact
 * order — Vital Pulse (full-width now that "Run complete audit" lives in
 * the page header instead, see Dashboard.tsx), VuloPilot activity (a
 * separate mockup screenshot — 5 real tiles, see VuloPilotActivityWidget.tsx's
 * own docblock for which real endpoint backs each one and why its mockup's
 * 6th tile, "Next audit", isn't included), Needs your attention (moved up
 * from STANDALONE_WIDGETS below to sit right under Vital Pulse, matching
 * the mockup), Key pages at a glance + Site snapshot (a new side-by-side
 * pair), Recent activity. Every pre-existing widget this mockup doesn't
 * show as its own card (Run Complete Audit, Recent Changes) is NOT removed —
 * per direct instruction, anything already on this Dashboard that isn't
 * depicted in the new mockup stays, appended immediately after this list
 * (still inside MOCKUP_WIDGETS, so the never-customized default layout
 * keeps them, just lower on the page).
 *
 * AI Suggestions and Today's Tasks WERE removed from here (per direct
 * instruction, after confirming the duplication) — not kept-but-appended
 * like the rest, because both were genuine content duplicates rather than
 * merely "not in the new mockup":
 * - AISuggestionsWidget.tsx's own docblock already said it "reads the same
 *   `/findings` endpoint NeedsAttentionWidget's 'Open issues' tab already
 *   uses" — same query, same real findings, just a second styling of the
 *   identical rows.
 * - TodaysTasksWidget.tsx read the same unfiltered `/activity-logs` feed
 *   RecentActivityWidget now reads (curated to a real, meaningful
 *   event-type subset) — confirmed live to show the same rows in practice.
 * Both component files are left in place, unused, rather than deleted
 * (same "supersede don't delete" posture this codebase already applies to
 * other superseded components) — their own docblocks now point at their
 * replacement. Removed from `Utill::DASHBOARD_WIDGET_IDS` too, so neither
 * can be re-added via "Customize dashboard" (the id is no longer valid) and
 * an existing saved layout naturally drops its now-meaningless entry for
 * either on its next reconciliation.
