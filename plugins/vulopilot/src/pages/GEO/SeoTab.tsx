/**
 * "SEO" tab of "SEO & Visibility" — restyled a 2nd time to match a newer

 * grid, "What should I fix first?"/"Pages that need attention"/"All SEO
 * findings" below, all real). One piece of that mockup is deliberately NOT
 * built here (direct instruction, after flagging it as genuinely unbacked
 * by any real data source): the "Page Analysis" panel — a live per-URL
 * check runner with a Search Preview snippet, per-check pass/fail list, and
 * a "Fix with AI" button. Nothing in this codebase runs a live check
 * against an arbitrary URL on demand like this; building it would mean a
 * genuinely new feature, not a restyle.
 *
 * Everything else here is real:
 * - "SEO Health Score" merges what used to be 2 separate cards (a plain
 *   ring + a separate 3-tile category grid) into the mockup's own single
 *   hero card: the same real ring, plus 4 real stat blocks (Pages checked/
 *   Issues found/Critical issues/High priority issues — `Seo.php`'s own
 *   `pages_checked`/`total_open`/`severity_breakdown`, `pages_checked`
 *   being the real published post+page count `SeoScanner` itself scans,
 *   not a separate invented definition). "Issues found"/"Critical"/"High"
 *   each get the one real delta above; "Pages checked" doesn't (no
 *   per-day history exists for that count, only for findings). 4 more real
 *   tiles (Latest score/Issues Fixed/New Issues/Pages Improved,
 *   `useSeoProgress()`'s own `GET /seo/progress`) are merged into this same
 *   tile row too, per direct instruction — originally a separate "SEO
 *   progress" card/section, folded in here instead of standing on its own.
 *   The mockup's own full historical trend chart ("Issues Fixed 126", "New
 *   Issues 32", "Pages Improved 14", a score-over-time sparkline) still
 *   isn't built — that needs many historical data points; only these 3 real
 *   week-over-week deltas were cheaply available without a new stored
 *   snapshot series.
 * - "SEO areas" is the same real per-category score grid as before, now 6
 *   tiles instead of 3 (`Seo.php`'s own docblock has the full scanner-id
 *   regrouping) with 2 more real numbers per tile (open issue count, real
 *   distinct affected-page count) alongside the existing score, plus a
 *   real 7th "All Areas" tile combining those 6 (`overallCategoryTrend()`'s
 *   own docblock) — same real overall numbers the "SEO Health Score" card
 *   above already shows, not a second invented total.
 * - "What should I fix first?"/"Pages that need attention"/"All SEO
 *   findings" are the same real `SeoIssuesSection`/`IssuesSection` this tab
 *   already had (priority stat cards + the 2 real tables) — unchanged.
 *
 * This tab used to own 5 category cards; 2 real overlaps were fixed (both
 * direct instruction), leaving the current 6 (was 3, further split this
 * pass — see `Seo.php`'s own docblock):
 * - "Links & Schema" → "Internal Linking" — real overlapping ownership
 *   with "SEO & Visibility"'s own dedicated Broken Links and Schema &
 *   Knowledge tabs, which already own `broken-links`/`schema`/
 *   `structured-data`/`sitewide-structured-data` findings. See
 *   seoSections.ts's own docblock for the full before/after breakdown.
 * - "XML Sitemap"/"Robots.txt" → dropped entirely, replaced by the tiny
 *   real "Search engine access" status line below — both are crawler/
 *   discovery controls, real overlapping ownership with "Grow My
 *   Traffic"'s own dedicated Crawler Traffic tab (since folded into
 *   "Crawl & URLs" — see CrawlUrlsTab.tsx's own docblock), which now owns
 *   real Robots.txt/XML Sitemap findings tables itself
 *   (CrawlRobotsSitemapSection.tsx, its own "Robots & Sitemap" inner
 *   tab). SEO keeps on-page SEO only now: titles, meta, headings,
 *   canonicals, images, and internal links.
 *
 * There's deliberately no "Ranking keywords" table the way the reference
 * mockup has one — this plugin has no real keyword-rank-tracking data
 * source anywhere (Free or Pro; SEO Copilot's own Pro pitch in Popup.tsx
 * already lists "Keyword rank tracking... Google Search Console
 * integration" as a still-unbuilt Pro feature) — an honest "not connected
 * yet" card sits where that table would go instead of fabricated
 * positions/volumes.
