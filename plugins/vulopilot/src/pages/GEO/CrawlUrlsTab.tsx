/**
 * "Crawl & URLs" tab of "SEO & Visibility" — merges 3 former standalone
 * tabs (Crawler Traffic, Broken Links, Redirects) plus the 404 log that
 * used to live bundled inside Broken Links, into one tab with 5 real
 * inner tabs (direct instruction: "Broken Links + Redirects + Crawler
 * Traffic are fragmented... And the Redirect screen also contains a 404
 * log... That creates four URL-maintenance concepts spread across three
 * tabs... one main tab: Crawl & URLs [with] Overview | Broken Links |
 * Redirects | 404s | Robots & Sitemap").
 *
 * Real inner tabs (a clickable `TabsComponent`), not one continuous
 * scrolling page — a deliberate departure from the "Schema & Knowledge"
 * tab's own precedent (SchemaKnowledgeTab.tsx's own docblock: "no inner
 * tab switcher... per direct instruction"), confirmed before building
 * this: each of these 5 sections is large on its own (Broken Links alone
 * was 1600+ lines before this split), so one continuous page here would
 * be a very long scroll rather than the cleaner navigation this merge is
 * actually meant to deliver.
 *
 * Every section is the exact same real component/logic that used to live
 * on its own top-level tab, moved here unchanged (Overview/Robots &
 * Sitemap were CrawlerTrafficTab.tsx, split into
 * CrawlOverviewSection.tsx/CrawlRobotsSitemapSection.tsx; Broken Links was
 * BrokenLinksTab.tsx, trimmed into BrokenLinksSection.tsx once its own
 * 404 log moved to NotFoundLogSection.tsx; Redirects was
 * RedirectsTab.tsx, renamed to RedirectsSection.tsx) — nothing here is a
 * rewrite, only a real reorganization of where each already-real section
 * lives. GEO.tsx no longer renders any of those 3 as sibling top-level
 * tabs; this component is the one place all 5 now live.
