/**
 * "Business Identity & Schema" tab of "SEO & Visibility" (renamed from
 * "Schema & Knowledge" — direct instruction, rebuilt to match a newer
 * reference mockup's own information architecture). Every section here
 * still renders on one continuous scrolling page under its own anchored
 * heading, same "no inner tab switcher" precedent this merge already
 * established (see this file's own earlier history) — the mockup's own
 * layout doesn't call for real inner tabs the way "Crawl & URLs" needed
 * them (CrawlUrlsTab.tsx), just a clearer visual order:
 *
 * The real "In plain English" `NoticeComponent` above item 1 is wrapped in
 * its own `ColumnComponent ` — every card row on this page shares
 * one implicit `.container-wrapper` flex-wrap context (there's no local
 * `ContainerComponent` per row), and `NoticeComponent` itself has no real
 * width of its own (sized to its own text content). Left unwrapped, it
 * silently shared a row with whatever `data-cols` card came right after it
 * instead of always starting a fresh row — invisible while that next card
 * was wide (the former grid=8 headline card below), but broke visibly the
 * moment 3 narrower grid=4 cards needed a clean row of their own.
 *
 * 1. `BusinessProfileCard.tsx` — "Business Profile", per a newer reference
 *    mockup: the same real `entity_score` gauge the former, narrower
 *    `BusinessUnderstandingCard.tsx` showed alone (now removed — this
 *    replaces it), beside a real per-field table of exactly what
 *    Services\EntityExtractor detected (business name/type, people,
 *    services, products, locations, contact details) and a real "Update
 *    Information" deep link. `CriticalIssuesCard.tsx`/`ValidSchemaCard.tsx`
 *    still render beside it, unchanged — real top-severity findings and
 *    real schema-coverage stats. See those 3 files' own docblocks for
 *    exactly which real data each shows.
 * 2. `KnowledgeGraphSection.tsx` — "What AI & Search Understand" (all 6
 *    real entity-type counts + a real hub-and-spoke diagram in the middle
 *    pane, moved up from that section's own sidebar to sit beside the
 *    list), then its own existing real detail cards/Pro slots. That
 *    diagram used to also render a 2nd time as its own standalone
 *    `KnowledgeGraphDiagramCard.tsx` card here — removed per direct
 *    instruction ("remove this section"), since it was the exact same
 *    real diagram (`KnowledgeGraphDiagramCard.tsx`'s own exported
 *    `KnowledgeGraphDiagram`) KnowledgeGraphSection.tsx's own middle pane
 *    already renders at `compact` size; that file itself still exists
 *    (and is still imported from) purely for that shared component, not
 *    as a standalone card any more — see its own docblock. That section
 *    used to also have its own "What should you check?" heuristic-checks
 *    panel — removed per direct instruction ("remove redundant content"):
 *    it was a 2nd, less-real "What Needs Fixing"-shaped card duplicating
 *    the real Issues table below, which already covers the same concept
 *    with real backend findings. See that section's own docblock. A 3rd
 *    such card — `WhatNeedsFixingCard.tsx`'s own top-3 findings preview,
 *    which used to render here between this section and the Issues
 *    table — was removed outright per direct instruction ("remove the
 *    card - What Needs Fixing"); `CriticalIssuesCard.tsx` above now
 *    covers the same "preview of real findings, link to the full table"
 *    role.
 * 3. `TechnicalDetailsSection.tsx` (NEW) — "Technical Details (Schema &
 *    Markup)", a real "Show for developers" toggle over
 *    `StructuredDataSection.tsx` (Schema Status stats + Schema Coverage
 *    table), unchanged internally.
 * 4. `InspectorSection.tsx` — "Page Inspector", its own separate section
 *    now (own `SectionComponent` heading, own anchor id
 *    `schema-knowledge-inspector`) rather than a 2nd tab inside item 2's
 *    own card — split out per direct instruction ("firstly separate
 *    section the page inspector"). Used to live nested inside
 *    KnowledgeGraphSection.tsx's own sidebar before that, then briefly a
 *    tab inside TechnicalDetailsSection.tsx — moved out both times since
 *    it's a schema concern with its own real, self-contained page-picker
 *    workflow, not a natural sub-tab of either. Internally unchanged.
 *
 * `initialSection` — set only when a bookmarked `?subtab=schema`/
 * `?subtab=knowledge-graph` link landed here (GEO.tsx's own
 * `SUBTAB_ALIASES`) — scrolls to the matching section on mount;
 * `'overview'` (the default) means "land at the top of the page."
