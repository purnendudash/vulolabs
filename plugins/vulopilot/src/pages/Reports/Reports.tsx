/**
 * "Reports" — a tab shell. A 4th tab, "History" (HistoryTab.tsx), was
 * added later — moved here from AI Copilot's own tab shell, which used
 * to render it alongside Chat; AI Copilot now renders Chat directly
 * (AIAssistant.tsx), same "drop to one real section, no tab bar" pattern
 * Commerce.tsx/Security.tsx already established. The reference mockup
 * originally showed 3 tabs (Overview/Report Builder/Scheduled Reports);
 * "Scheduled Reports" has
 * since been merged into "Report Builder" per direct instruction (its
 * content — ReportSchedulesSummary.tsx plus the Pro schedule-management
 * panel — now lives inside ReportTab.tsx's own second section; see that
 * file's own docblock), leaving Overview/Report Builder/Activity
 * (ActivityTab.tsx, folded in from its own now-removed native WP submenu
 * row, per classes/Admin.php's legacy_submenus() docblock), same "match
 * the mockup's own visible tabs, don't delete real functionality the
 * mockup doesn't happen to show" move Protect My Site's own
 * Performance-tab addition already made for Site Health/Files & Plugins.
 * There was also briefly a flat "Security" tab here (Reports/SecurityTab.tsx,
 * `category="security"` FindingsTable) — removed per direct instruction;
 * Protect My Site's own Security tab (SecurityTab.tsx) is the real,
 * complete home for security findings now (it scopes to a full
 * 14-scanner-id list rather than the narrower `category="security"` this
 * deleted tab used, so nothing here was lost — the deleted tab actually
 * undercounted relative to it).
 *
 * - Overview (OverviewTab.tsx) — the redesigned mockup's own dashboard.
 * - "Report" is relabeled "Report Builder" here (ReportTab.tsx —
 *   today's real report-generation/list page, now also the real home for
 *   scheduled reports).
 *
 * Same `subtab` deep-link convention as every other tab shell
 * (`?page=vulopilot#&tab=reports&subtab=<inner-tab>`). Tab bar/body are
 * `NavigatorComponent` (`variant="tab"`) rather than a bare `TabsComponent`
 * — same real settings-navigator component AIAssistant.tsx's own tab shell
 * already uses, reused here instead of hand-rolling a second `TAB_IDS`-
 * driven tab bar. `headerTitle`/`headerDescription` are deliberately left
 * unset on it — this page's own `NavigatorHeaderComponent` above already
 * renders the page header, and passing them here would render a second,
 * duplicate one (`NavigatorHeaderComponent` only renders when at least one
 * of the two is set). `NavigatorComponent` also wraps its own tab body in
 * `ContainerComponent general` internally, so — unlike the old
 * `TabsComponent`, which needed one wrapped around it here to match the
 * left padding every other tab shell's own `ContainerComponent` already
 * gave it — there's no separate wrapper needed around it now. Each tab's
 * `hideSettingHeader: true` suppresses `NavigatorComponent`'s own per-tab
 * title/description section, since `OverviewTab`/`ReportTab`/`ActivityTab`
 * already render their own.
