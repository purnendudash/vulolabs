 * The mockup's top section — "I found N security issues" (Pro's real
 * severity breakdown when licensed, Free's honest open-count fallback
 * otherwise; see VulnerabilityHeroCard's own docblock), the "What
 * VuloPilot is checking" tile grid, and the "Security Status" score gauge
 * — factored out of SecurityTab.tsx (Protect My Site's "Security"
 * tab) into its own component since a near-identical version of this
 * same top section briefly also lived on a second "Old Security" tab
 * before that tab was removed. Deliberately the exact same grid={8}/
 * grid={4} nesting OverviewTab.tsx's own hero row uses (SecurityMetricsGrid
 * *inside* the grid={8} column alongside the hero card, not full-width
 * outside it — SecurityMetricsGrid's own 2-tile grid is deliberately
 * sized for that narrower column; getting this nesting wrong once made
 * an earlier pass render 4 tiles per row here instead of the mockup's 2).
 *
 * RecentActivityCard/SecurityTrendCard (real daily score history, its own
 * dedicated table — see that component's own docblock) stack
 * directly below SecurityStatusCard in this same grid={4} sidebar column
 * (per direct instruction — one after another, narrow, not a separate
 * full-width 3-column row) rather than living in SecurityTab.tsx
 * as a standalone row.
