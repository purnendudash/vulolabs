/**
 * The Issues table's right-side detail panel — mockup shows "Why it
 * matters"/"What VuloPilot recommends"/"How to fix" sections, but no
 * scanner anywhere writes that copy (ScannerInterface only ever produces
 * title/severity/category/description — see FindingRepository::get_finding_groups()'s
 * own docblock), so this only ever shows real fields: the group's real
 * severity/category/count/detected-date (a top stat-tile row, same real
 * "Priority/Category/Affected/Detected" shape that mockup's own header
 * used), one real representative finding's own title/description/page
 * ("Example finding" — clearly framed as one instance, not a fabricated
 * summary of the whole group), and real bulk actions (Fix/Resolve all/
 * Ignore all) scoped to every open finding in the group, not just the one
 * example shown. While Pro is inactive, the footer swaps those 3 real
 * (but locked/disabled) actions for 2 real, clickable upgrade actions
 * ("Upgrade to Pro"/"Unlock fix details" — both just open the existing
 * `ShowProPopup` lightbox, same real destination the section overlays
 * below already open) — per direct instruction, matching that mockup's
 * own real footer functionality instead of showing 3 dead buttons.
 *
 * Performance findings are one exception to "no scanner writes that copy"
 * above: every `classes/Scanners/Basic/*Scanner.php` under the
 * `performance` category now writes a real, scanner-specific
 * `recommended_fix` step list into `Finding::get_meta()` (e.g. CdnScanner's
 * own "sign up for a CDN"/"confirm assets resolve through it"/… steps) —
 * genuine, accurate remediation guidance, not fabricated data. When a
 * performance finding's sample carries that list, this panel swaps
 * "Example finding" for "Recommended fix" (a numbered step list, per
 * direct instruction matching a reference design) instead of the generic
 * title/description/page example.
 *
 * `WordPressHealthScanner`/`ServerHealthScanner` (categories `wordpress`/
 * `server`) are the other exception — both wrap `WP_Site_Health`, whose own
 * test descriptions are genuinely built from separate HTML paragraphs (a
 * "why this matters" explanation, then a "what was actually found" detail)
 * before WordPress core hands them back as one flattened string; those two
 * scanners now recover that real split (`split_into_paragraphs()`, never
 * fabricated) into `meta.why_it_matters`/`meta.what_happened`. When
 * present, `why_it_matters` renders as its own always-visible section (not
 * Pro-gated — general educational content, not per-site data) and
 * `what_happened` takes over the swappable section in place of "Example
 * finding", the same way `recommended_fix` does for Performance. Every
 * other category (20 of 22) still shows "Example finding" as before, since
 * no other scanner writes either of these fields.
 *
 * The header's own `desc` deliberately shows the sample's `title` (short)
 * rather than its `description` (long) — the latter is already shown once,
 * in full, by whichever of the three sections above ends up rendering; an
 * earlier version of this panel showed the same long description in both
 * places. "Affected items" below has the same care taken: `group.sample`
 * is normally also the first row that list's own fetch would return (both
 * read the same scanner_id ordered by id desc), so `otherAffectedItems`
 * filters that one row out — this list only ever shows open findings
 * genuinely NOT already covered by "Recommended fix"/"What happened"/
 * "Example finding" above.
